    "text": "1.1 Content Summary\nThis week’s topic was primarily focused on the introduction to the background science and techniques associated with remote sensing. This included background information on the electromagnetic spectrum and spectral profiles of distinct materials, numerous technologies that one can use to perform remote sensing (R, Python, SNAP, QGIS, ENVI), and the process of sourcing images with satellites, drones, planes and the potential problems experienced during this process like scattering and cloud cover.\nMoving onto the practical, three main sections were of most importance: initial exploratory analysis in SNAP with sentinel imagery, masking a location of interest and creating land use polygons with both sentinel and landsat imagery, and ascertaining the spectral signatures of each land use type in graphical form using R. Performing this week’s practical proved difficult as creating an account with sentinel to download data was not working during the practical session or several days after, though at the time of writing the issue has been solved. This meant that my interaction with the practical was limited to reading through the practical page and understanding the concepts while drawing on experience in a previous remote sensing class during my undergrad to conceptualize the processes in the practical.\nThe following images display a true color RGB image of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, USA, and a false color composite image using near infrared, short wave infrared 1, and short wave infrared 2 bands displayed in ENVI created when I was an undergrad.\nAdditionally, this image displayed a tasseled cap image of the National Mall in Washington DC, also created when I was an undergrad. Because I have already performed many of the actions within this practical, an inability to participate fully was not completely damaging. In fact, even without completing the SNAP portion and merely studying the code, I am still left with a number of valuable lessons and questions. Never had I resampled the resolution of an image and this seems vastly useful for comparative projects, though I still wonder about the real world practicality of apps like ENVI and SNAP as I also have experience with RS in python. I will reflect more on this in the reflection section, but aside from their advantages in image visibility, with the amount of experience that I have, I would always choose either R (based on what I saw in the practical) or python in conjunction with a true GIS (QGIS or Arc (if I had access)).",

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nGiven that this week was quite introductory to both the science and methods of remote sensing, I wanted to include a project that I have worked on outside of the classroom that involved a LiDAR point cloud to create a hillshade model. The Northern Virginia Solar Map (“HOME  Novasolarmap” (n.d.)) is a tool developed to estimate the solar energy potential for all buildings in the south western suburbs of Washington DC. The current linked version was developed using data from 2015 and is currently under an update using LiDAR data from 2023, and this update is the part I was a part of. Even though this week’s class mainly focused on spectral signatures, tasseled cap plots, and resampling, the lecture briefly touched on LiDAR point clouds. This project made use of LiDAR point cloud data ascertained from the private sector to create a more accurate digital surface model than one obtained from satellite imagery. Then using ArcGIS, the DSM was clipped to a shapefile of building footprints and a tool was run to determine the solar absorption with respect to roof angle, casted shadows, elevation, azimuth angle, etc for different times of the year. Despite only one element of remote sensing (LiDAR point cloud), this Solar Map has remained successful in increasing the amount of homes and businesses powered by solar energy in Northern Virginia. \nThe second application that I want to highlight is more directly linked to our studies this week. This Study by Schroeter and Gläβer (2011) displays the utility of spectral signatures to group lakes next to coal mines in Germany by potential exposure to polluting runoff. These lake classifications include “iron buffer, aluminum/iron buffer, aluminum/hydrocarbonate buffer, hydrocarbonate buffer, and carbonate buffer.” Specifically, these buffers (in the order they were written) indicate the dominant chemical controlling the PH of the water in the lake. A lake with high iron levels is extremely acidic and indicates a heavily polluted lake while a lake with high carbonate levels indicates a reclaimed lake with a neutral PH. Because iron, aluminum, hydrocarbons, and carbonates when dissolved in water all have different spectral signatures in the visible color range (that is to say they are different in color to the naked eye), the researchers were able to identify differences in the lakes’ composition without false color composites. This study displays the potential of remote sensing for environmental protection.",

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nConsidering that I have already taken two remote sensing based classes in undergrad, my main conclusions about this week’s content serve as reaffirmations of lessons that I have previously learned: RS specific apps seem clunky and don’t seem incredibly relevant outside of classrooms and RS seems to be a starting point for many projects rather than the end goal. As mentioned above, I have found both ENVI and now SNAP to be very friendly for initiation into RS as the can create tasseled cap graphs quickly, display movable images, and operate like a GIS, but after seeing the potential of R to make the spectral signature graphs and conduction a rather long flood risk analysis using landsat imagery in python in a previous undergraduate class, I feel that SNAP can serve a great supplementary tool for RS, but I would always gravitate to a R or Python for a larger project. For that reason, I am incredibly excited to learn google earth engine later this term as I hope it can act as a middle ground between the visibility benefits of SNAP and the practicality benefits of python or R. Secondly, one element I have found interesting at every step of my RS education, is that it often forms the baseline for any number of different projects. In the Solar Map, the aim was to support a goal created by the Northern Virginia Regional Commission to increase solar energy consumption in the area, and using LiDAR points to create a DSM was part of that. In the German coal mine study, the goal was to run cluster analysis on the quality of lakes in the region to assess environmental health, and spectral signatures of different pollutants were required to do that. One of the reasons I have enjoyed learning about Remote Sensing over the years is that any single technique may be quite limited in its ability to recognize a particular pattern, with only a single conclusion one can argue for policy change, warn of imminent danger, analyze progress, etc.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Content Summary\nThe content about corrections for week three comes mostly from the lecture. Four types of image corrections were covered this week: geometric, atmospheric, orthorectification, and radiometric calibration. Geometric Correction involves assigning known ground control locations via regression analysis to a remotely sensed image that does not have a geographic reference system. Atmospheric correction relates to removing blurring in an image caused by light scattering and absorption, either relatively or absolutely. Orthorectification looks to transform an image from the view of a sensor to the view of a map. This involves correcting the value of each pixel by assigning it a nadir view value. Radiometric Calibration involves converting digital numbers (specific to each sensor) that measure the brightness of each pixel into spectral radiance values which measure how much light a sensor picks up for each pixel at a certain band or wavelength.\nThese corrections are vital to a productive remote sensing project, and because of that, most sources of R.S. data will provide pre-corrected images for download. Despite the importance of these processes that create usable imagery, in practice, image enhancements like ratios and filters are more pertinent to relevant remote sensing outputs. Ratio enhancements make use of different spectral signatures across bands to highlight areas of bare soil, healthy vegetation, developed land, etc. Filter enhancements allow the smoothing (low pass) or sharpening (high pass) to diminish or enhance variance across pixels.\nThe most important utility of both image corrections and enhancements is the ability to specify a general image into a more objective means of data collection. Despite this, when considering large areas many enhancements like filtering, PCA, and texturing can be computationally intense. Given that this is my third RS based class, I am quite confident in my understanding of corrections and ratio enhancements, but I found that my understanding of corrections in particular was not clear until I participated in the process. Personally calculating DNs to spectral radiance and applying ground control points to an image helped me understand the concepts of nadir, azimuth, TOA reflectance, radiance, etc. In effect I see pre-corrected data as a great disseminator of RS potential, but also as an obstructor of true understanding.",

    "text": "3.2 Applications\n\n3.2.1 Articles\nThe articles I wanted to include this week relate to parts of the practical that I spent the most time working on, ratio and filter enhancements. The first paper by Son Le, Liou, and Pham (2023) uses Landsat imagery and a fairly complex ratio to analyze surface water presence to analyze both potential water scarcity and disease presence in rice fields in Vietnam. The ratio is called the normalized difference latent heat index (NDLI) and it is obtained from this equation:\n\\(NDLI = [Green - Red]/[Green + Red + SWIR]\\)\nThe utility of this ratio was tested against another common method to assess rice crop health and water supply known as SEBAL or surface energy balance algorithm for land. In brief summary, the NDLI (particularly in conjunction with surface temperature measurements) was able to more clearly detect water, vegetation, soil, and tidal regions than the more common SEBAL method. This led to more accurate and proactive analysis of the health of the rice paddies.\nThe second paper by Chen et al. (2022) uses drone/plane imagery and a bilateral filtering technique to balance smoothing and sharpness in images plagued by noise. The first filter is a standard low pass filter with a large kernel width that smooths edges and reduces the effect of “erratic noise” (page 1). The second filter is also a low pass, but with a much smaller kernel width which takes the now reduced-noise-free image and reshapes the edges that we lost in the first pass.\nThe strength of this method is tested against other bilateral filters that only pass one time. In short, the two pass filter produced images that were both free of noise and had sharp edges where pixel variance was high (something missing from the other methods). Notably though, the authors do highlight the increased computation time of the two pass filters.\n\n\n3.2.2 Thoughts\nThe main theme that I see in this research is that, although both paper describe a notable improvement in an RS method, they are not trying to reinvent the wheel or completely change our way of thought. Son Le, Liou, and Pham (2023) still focus on well known ratio methods, they just find a better one for their situation. equally, Chen et al. (2022) apply known filtering methods, just with an improvement. Even in the lecture we saw that dark object subtraction was under some scrutiny, not because it’s pointless, but because other methods are better and just as simple to implement.",

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nIn the previous section, much of the covered topics reflect the more objective utility of remote sensing as a tool for scientific output, and this is incredibly important. However, a part of the lecture and practical that I haven’t touched on yet seems most relevant to this section: the blurring of RS from science into art. From the beginning, the display of an image is key to the understanding of effectively every process covered so far. The goal of corrections is to display the image as true to the materials captured as possible, the point of ratios is to display where certain attributes are most prominent, textures allows us to display certain features with an emphasis on their importance to out use case, and even a simple false color composite changes the understanding of an image by changing the display. To me, it seems that the visual nature of remote sensing makes the processes one decides to use in a project inherently subjective. The overarching goal change from, how do I share my findings, to, how can I show my findings? With that said, I found that the R studio code for the practical to be incredibly simple to follow. Even for seemingly complex tasks like the texture analysis, the numerous RS specific libraries made any code block more than 3 lines long quite rare. On top of that, using simple raster plots allowed me to play around with different compost images and ratio thresholds to, again, think about how I would display my findings in a certain project.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Solar Energy Planning Goals:\nHow Can EO data be used to inform on and suggest strategies to increase solar energy use in industrial regions of the county?\n\n\n4.1.2 Quick Background\nLoudoun county is the fourth most populous first level locality (city or county) in the State of Virginia with a population of around 440,000 as estimated in 2024 by the University of Virginia Cooper Center for Public Service. It makes up part of the hearth of Northern Virginia or NoVA which as a whole forms the south western suburbs of Washington D.C. (“Virginia Population Estimates  Cooper Center” n.d.)\n\n\n\nNorthern Virginia, USA, Made with Python Matplotlib\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Loudoun County Solar Energy Planning:\nLoudoun county contains “the largest concentration of data centers in the world.” This has strained the local power grid as electricity usage “largely due to data centers” has limited Loudoun’s sustainability as the industry forces increased use of fossil fuels for power (“Energy Management  Loudoun County, VA - Official Website” n.d., 7, 45). Combining the immense energy usage of data centers with residential rooftop solar production goals in Loudoun, noted on page 19 of Loudoun County’s 2023 Energy Strategy, could see large industrial buildings form solar farms that would contribute green sourced energy to the local electric grid and decrease reliance on fossil fuels to power the ever demanding data center industry.\n\n\n4.1.4 Northern Virginia Solar Energy Planning:\nAs seen in chapter 1 of this diary, the Virginia side of the Washington D.C metro area has already established increasing solar energy as goal for the wider region, and EO has been used to so. The Northern Virginia Solar Map estimates potential solar energy production for each building within the data set (“HOME  Novasolarmap” (n.d.)). However, the current map uses data from 2015 and a recent attempt (that I formed part of) to update the map with 2023 data was cancelled because of federal funding cuts. This means that the current NoVA solar map cannot accurately serve as a tool for solar potential estimation or policy support for any building constructed or modified after winter 2015. This further supports other forms of Earth observation to be used for solar potential for Loudoun County’s industrial areas.",

    "text": "4.2 Potential Data\nUnlike the NoVA Solar Map which used privately collected LiDAR data and ArcGIS tools as its primary method of solar potential calculation, this policy looks to open source data collected by Loudoun County as well as R-studio or Python for calculation. This would allow for all steps to be repeated by any locality in the world assuming they had equivalent data. With that, much of the analysis required for assessing solar potential come from a 2015 paper by Horvath et al. in which aerial imagery is used to assess the area of a building, roof shape, and potential obstructions in order to create a usable area coefficient for already known solar potential calculations. (Horváth, Kassai-Szoó, and Csoknyai 2016)\nUsing the same principle with Loudoun County data and avoiding expensive high resolution LiDAR, a typology for data centers in Loudoun can be created. This would benefit from most data centers following a similar architectural design. Additionally and most importantly, the “Loudoun Imagery 2025” data from the Loudoun County GeoHub provides 1 foot (0.3048 meters) resolution which would allow the base typology to assess roof angle and building height while variables like shadow blockage, roof installments (e.g HVAC units), and building area to vary in the usable area coefficient of the solar potential formula.\n\n\n\nData Center Complex, Ashburn, Loudoun County, VA\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Dynamic Potential:\nAs previously mentioned regarding the NoVA solar map, one of the downsides of high resolution LiDAR is that the projects it serves can often have a short life span for informing policy. Altought he Solar Map still provides useful predictions for a majority of the residents and businesses of Northern Virginia, updating the map is expensive and labor intensive. Creating solar estimates without high resolution LiDAR creates a path for repeatable and temporally dynamic estimates. Because Loudoun’s 1ft resolution imagery is updated once per year, a dynamic threshold for solar energy production of all data centers (and other large industrial buildings) could be changed as Loudoun continues to pursue integration of the data center industry.",

    "text": "4.3 Take Aways\nGiven my experience as both a recent former resident of Northern Virginia and a member of the team attempting to update the NoVA solar map, I am already familiar with the numerous statewide and NoVA regional incentives to introduce solar energy more into individual buildings and the wider power grid. However, my understanding of data centers, particularly in Loudoun County, was tailored by typically disgruntled Loudoun residents and politicians expressing their disgust with the rapid growth of the industry since around 2010. This combined with the growth of the data center industry in other parts of Virginia, most notably the Richmond area around 160 km south, led me to assume that Loudoun had nearly capped it’s introduction of data centers. However, the Loudoun County’s 2023 Energy Strategy confirms the exact opposite, and reiterates the need for supplementation to the power grid. Specifically, in 2022, Loudoun estimated that by 2030 there would be a 12 million square foot (roughly 1.1 million square meter) increase in data center floor space. Additionally the Energy Strategy mentions “no specific strategies to reduce energy consumption of data centers” which further supports the idea of combining the already existing plans for increasing residential solar energy with the continued growth of data centers. (“Energy Management  Loudoun County, VA - Official Website” n.d., 15, 40)\nLastly, my perception of how solar energy is calculates using Earth Observation data was obscured by the use of ArcGIS in the NoVA Solar Map. In that project, all I knew is that LiDAR was used to create a DEM and then the ESRI solar estimation tool would spit out a layer of solar estimation. I now understand, after reading the Horvath et al. paper, that as long a the usable area is attained a standard formula can be applied. This is why I decided to focus on open source high spatial resolution as the formula could be applied to any data center complex with adequate imagery.",
