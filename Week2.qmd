title: "Week2: Introduction to Quarto and Xaringan"
---

# Why so Short This Week?

This week was dedicated to learning how to use quarto books (the very tool I used for you to read this :D) and Xaringan (the tool used for our future group presentation).

The summary, applications, and reflection this week are held within a xaringan presentation and relate to a specific satellite of my choosing. **Spoiler Alert**: I chose the GEDI LiDAR sensor on the ISS. In any case, I suppose I should stop stalling and let you see the presentation.
